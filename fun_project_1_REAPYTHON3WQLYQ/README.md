# 🍰 Which Pastry Are You?

A fun personality quiz app built with Streamlit as part of my AI Bootcamp portfolio.

This project was my first mini project to practice working with Python, Streamlit, and session state. It's simple, interactive, and dessert-themed — because learning should be fun!

---

## 🎯 What's the point?

Just for fun! You answer a few questions, and based on your choices, you’ll get matched with a dessert + a career idea. Sweet and simple.

## 🧁 How it works

1. You enter your name
2. You answer 3 questions:

   * How you work
   * What you do when stressed
   * Your favorite flavor
3. The app shows you a result (dessert + career)
4. You get a random dessert quote too 🍩
5. You can click "Try again" to restart
